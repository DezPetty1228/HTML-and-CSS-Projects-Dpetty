<blockquote cite="https://be.chewy.com/dog-breed/rottweiler/">
Rottweilers are one of the top 10 dog breeds in the United States, and it’s no wonder why. They are amazing guard dogs, super smart and easy to train. These high-energy dogs are great for active people who are looking for one dog to call their own. While they’re vigilant in protecting their home, they can be loving goofballs around their family. They’ve also found skills as guide and therapy dogs, making them a great dog for an experienced pup parent. For the right family, a Rottweiler means you’ll never lack a buddy for life’s adventures.
